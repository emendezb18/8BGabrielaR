    <h4>What was the Kosovo War?</h4>

    <p>The Kosovo War was a big event that happened from February 28, 1998, to June 11, 1999 it was remembered as a very big Yugoslavian war.

        The groups involved were Albania, Serbia, Yugoslavia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Turkey, and North Macedonia.
        
        The war originated because the Kosovar government stopped recognizing Serbian identity documents which led to a fight in this war Serbia lost control against the Turkish.
        
        There were a lot of deaths on both sides, but because of strategy and will Kosovo was the winner and could be an independent country.
        
        A change in Kosovo thanks to the war is that they are an independent country but they became free in a unilateral way, so Serbians do not accept it.
        
        All this war ended up with a peace treaty called the Kumanovo treatment Yugoslavians and Serbians decided to stop the attacks because it was not worth losing more soldiers.
        
        The ELK was an organization that helped Kosovo to win the war they fought against the ethnic Albanians organization and repression of political dissent.
        
        The Serbian ruler named Slovedan Milesovic in 1989 was having many discriminative attempts against others ordered by him.
        
        For me, the justified side was the Kosovo people because they wanted to be free but the Serbians didnâ€™t let them so their only way to get to their freedom was to fight for it. So I agree with what the Kosovo people did.
        </p>
    <p>The Kosovo war was fought were the ethnic Albanians who opposed Serbia's rules and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the government ( also like the republics of Serbia and Montenegro). Those people were called the Kosovo Albanian rebels, known as the Kosovo Liberation Army.</p>
